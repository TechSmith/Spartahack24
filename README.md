# SwiftUI Hackathon demo

This repository contains all sources featured in TechSmith's SwiftUI talk, including:
* **SwiftBasics.playground**: A demonstration of basic Swift syntax, type-safety, and data structures
* **SwiftUI Demo**: A simple SwiftUI Xcode project showing the basics of SwiftUI
* **MSU Landmarks app**: A more complex SwiftUI app showcasing cross-platform compatibility and the SwiftData framework

All of these are freely available for you to download and play around with! *As an additional challenge,* try and add SwiftData compatibility to the `LandmarkAdderView`, so that saved Landmarks are retained between launches.

You can find the slide deck for our presentation [here](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1hZXTmvCr9547s19jv7j0u7y5-PbRQ3derijyKuYg0CU)
